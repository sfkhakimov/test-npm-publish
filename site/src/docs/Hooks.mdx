## [Hooks](#hooks)

There are two main hooks you can use to control the guide in your components: `useVoyager` and `useVoyagerHelpers`

<br />

### useVoyager:

<br />

`isOpen`: indicates whether the guide is currently active or not.

`currentStep`: the index of the current step.

`steps`: an array containing your guide steps.

`currStep`: the current step.

`nextStep`: move to the next step.

`prevStep`: move to the previous step.

`startAt`: the step at which the guide started.

`status`: the current status of the step (VoyagerStatusesEnum).


<br />

### useVoyagerHelpers:

<br />

`start`: initiates the guide (transitions to VoyagerStatusesEnum.Active).

`stop`: stops the guide (transitions to VoyagerStatusesEnum.Stopped).

`goNextStep`: navigates to the next step.

`goBackStep`: navigates to the previous step.

`goToStep`: navigates to a specific step, taking the step index as an argument.

`skip`: skips and completes the guide (transitions to VoyagerStatusesEnum.Skipped).

`updateSteps`: updates the steps of your guide, taking the step selector and StepType as arguments.
