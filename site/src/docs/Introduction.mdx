## [Introduction](#introduction)

Once, I faced the task of creating a large interactive guide to lead users through a specific website usage process.
I experimented with libraries such as `react-joyride` and `reactour`. While these are great libraries, they didn't quite suit my task's conditions.
I needed to consider that an element might not appear immediately on the page, or its dimensions could change.
It might move, or the user could accidentally reload the page. That's when the idea of creating a new library to solve these issues came to mind.
